Greetings ✨ !!
CodSoft Internship Update:
 I'm glad to share that I've successfully completed Task 1 of my internship at CodSoft.
 
 ---Task 1: NUMBER GUESSING GAME---

💻 How the Game Works:
 1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
 2. The user enter their guess.
 3. The program compares the guess to the random number and proves feedback as follows:
 - If the guess is too high: "Too high!"
 - If the guess is too low: "Too low!"
 - If the guess is correct: "Congratulations!"
 4. The steps repeat until the user guesses correctly.
 5. The program displays the number of attempts it took to guess the number.

📍 Key Learnings:
 - This task highlights the importance clear and concise code structure for readability and maintainablility.
 - Developing control flow in C++.

This task sharpened my C++ skills with a classic number guessing game! This task allowed me to practice core programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements etc., Excited for the next task 🌟 !!
